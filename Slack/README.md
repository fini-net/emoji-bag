# Slack emojis

Slack is deprecated because Salesforce bought them and since then
there has been steady enshittification.  The free tier is less and
less useful.  I've only been using it to take temporary notes for
months.  Noone else has participated in our Slack in years.  So
Slack is deprecated and could be deleted someday.  It must be nice
to be the top dog and not care about the small fries any more.
